# Unit 22 - System Conversion, Maintenance and Documentation
---
## System conversions
### Direct cutover conversion
Fewer resources are required.
It can be very risky because there is no backup system available.
### Parallel conversion
Both new and old systems are used at the same time, so the risk can be minimized.
Two system can be compared and choose the better one after the conversion.
It double the resources needed to run two systems at the same time.
### Phased conversion
This is a large-scale modular conversion. Components are changed from time to time. It is a mix of direct and parallel conversion. It is suitable in a complex system.
Errors can be found easily.
It has lower risk because failures occur in a new phase will not make the entire system fail.
This will create more work and increase complexity.
### Pilot conversion
Pilots use the new system first to see if the new system has no failures.
Losses can be reduced.
Errors can be fixed before public release.
## System maintenance
To correct faults, improve performance or other attributes and make the product adapt to a modified enviroment.
System maintenance includes:
- Corrective maintenance
- Adaptive maintenance
- Perfective maintenance
- Preventive maintenance

## User training
End users, computer operators, professionals need to be trained.
User support should be provided by the system, in the form of
- online documentation; or
- forum

## Documentation
System documentation and technical documentation should be created.
Technical documentation should include codes and test data.
