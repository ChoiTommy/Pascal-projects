# Unit 23 - Alternative Approaches and Related Jobs of System Development
---
## Limitation and variations of waterfall model
Waterfall model is poorly adapted to changes and no going back.
Waterfall model with feedback, waterfall model with overlapping stages and incremental development (waterflow model with iteration) are another approaches based on the original waterfall model.
## Prototype approach
An incomplete but working product is made. It can collect and understand user requirements.
It can also be used to check feasiblity of a certain approach to fulfil the needs of the organization.
It can't eleminate all risks.
## Rapid application development (RAD) approach
Making prototypes, waterflow model with overlapping stages and incremental development are RAD approaches.
With computer-aided software engineering (CASE) and programmers, the cost involved may not necessarily be lower than when using traditional waterfall model.
## Related jobs of system development
### Project manager
Project manager is responsible for initiation, planning, execution and closure of a system development project.
### System analyst
System analysts are mainly responsible for analysing and designing systems needed by users.
### Programmer
Programmers are responsible for developing the system software in the system implemention stage.
### Database administrator (DBA)
Database administrator is responsible for design, management and maintenance of the database.
### Computer operator
Computer operators are responsible for carrying out scheduled system work, such as start-up, control and backup activities.
### Technical support staff
Technicians are responsible for providing support for end users.
