# Unit 21 - System Implementation
---
## Introduction
System implementation

> the stage after system design in SDLC

## Types of testing
Valid test is to check different cases of a system. Usually normal cases and boundary cases are being tested.
Invalid test is to check if error is raised when some invalid data is being processed.
Expected output and actual output are two things you need to compare when performing a system test.
### Unit test
It usually test individual modules of a system. Test cases should be prepared during the testing.
### System test
This is usually done after the unit test. It tests a couples of units at the same time.
### Volume test
It tests if the system can handle the large amount of users or data at the same time.
### Storage test
It determines whether the storage capacity of a system is able to store all transaction data.
### Performance time test
It determines the length of time used by the system to process data.
### User Acceptance test (UAT)
It tests if the user accepts all functions in the system. It shows if the system meet all user requirements stated in the system analysis stage.
