# Unit 20 - System Design
---
## Introduction
System design

> A translation of user requirements into processes and methods

## Function parts of computer-based systems
### 1.Hardware platforms
They are chosen based om expected workload. They differ mainly in **computational power** and **storage capacity**. Computation power is based on the **processors**, **main memory**, storage devices, input and output devices chosen.
### 2.Software
Ways to acquire software for systems:
- Developing custom software

|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|
|Able to cater for special business needs|**Long development time** and high cost and risk|
- Purchasing **commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS)** software

|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|
|Lower initial and maintenance cost, **reliable functionalities**|**Less customization**|
- Employing an **application service provider (ASP)**

|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|
|**Meet the needs** of most organizations and reduce cost in hiring or training a group of IT staff|General control of organization data, clientâ€™s privacy, information systems and project schedules may be sacrificed|
### 3. User interface
User interface
: refers to graphics, textual, auditory information present to users
#### Command line interface (CLI)
Users need to input commands to control the system.
|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|
|**Low** requirements of hardware, needs much less RAM in order to use|**Difficult for inexperienced users to use**, not capable of handling multimedia information|
#### Graphical user interface (GUI)
It features windows, graphical icons, menus and the use of pointing devices (**WIMP**). It allows users to input commands by selecting menu options or clicking buttons.
For portable devices, touch screen is used to facilitate the communication between users and devices.
|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|
|Users can learn to use in less time, good at presenting graphical information (**multimedia**)|Efficiency and productivity are lower|
### 3. Database structure
Table is a collections of related records, and a record is a collection of related fields.A key field can be used to uniquely identify a record.
Database structure must be designed to **meet system requirements**.
System designer needs to define the fields, data type, the key field, and the relationships between tables.
### 4. Data control
Garbage-in-garbage-out (GIGO)
**Data validation and verification** methods.
## User Interface and Human-computer Interaction
### 1. Physical aspect of user interface
Includes all **physical devices** (input and output devices).
For exmaple, user manuals, keyboards, scanners, speakers, etc. 
### 2. Perceptual aspect of user interface
Includes everything the user **sees and hears**.
For example, data, information, program menus, toolbars, instructions, text, graphics and audio displayed.
### 3. Conceptual aspect of user interface
Includes what the **user need to know** when using the system.
For example, operation available in the system or necessary procedures to perform a task and the related regulations.
### 4. Guidelines of user interface design
Basic principles: **visibility** and **affordance**.
#### Visibility
System control objects should be visible to users.
They should provide intermediate feedback to show they are working properly.
#### Affordance
The appearance of a system control object should give essential clues on its functionality.
