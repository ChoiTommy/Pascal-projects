##Question 1

*To a large extend I think the theme song describes the personality and life experiences of Judy Hopps. In the lyrics of the theme song, there are some lines like `I won’t give up, no I won’t give in` and `I wanna try everything`. These lines reflect the personality of Judy. She will not give up when she faces difficulties. She didn’t give up even Chief Bogo has given her parking duties, and she has done her job responsibly. For her life experiences, `I keep falling down` and `I lost another fight` show that Judy Hopps has faced lots of difficulties in the investigation in the movie. Judy doesn’t give up even she is only given 48 hours to solve the case. She once quits her job, but at last she returns to Zootopia and she continues her investigation.
	
*I think Officer Clawhauser in the film best describe me. He is helpful and always helps Judy Hopps when she needs help. I think I am the same as him because I always help others when they are in need too. Also, he loves eating donuts. I am also fond of sweet things, such as candies, chocolates and cakes. So, I think Officer Clawhauser best represent me.
	
*I would recommend the film Zootopia to my family because the film conveys lots of messages. For example, it tells people not to stereotype others and discriminate others. I think it is important to let my family members to learn these. Having so many kinds of stereotyping and discrimination in the society, everyone should stop stereotyping and discriminating others. I would also recommend this film to my friends because the film is funny and there is a lot attractive animation. They can be attracted and learn the messages behind the film.

##Question 2

*I think Judy and Nick have some painful experiences in the film. When Judy says that the animal going savage is because of their biology, Nick becomes sad and disappointed because he thinks Judy is still afraid of himself. Also, Nick is aware that Judy is always carrying a fox repellent in her pocket. These make Nick feel that Judy doesn’t trust him.
	
*Judy realizes that she has hurt Nick, so she finds where Nick is and apologize to him. She says she trust Nick and feels sorry for what she said that day. Nick accepts her apology. They continue to work together and investigate for the reason of predators going savage. Finally, Nick accepts to get into the police academy and be the first fox as a cop. So they get through it and make up again. 

*I have had the experience of getting somebody wrong and hurting that person. Once I scolded at my mum because I think she has thrown away my favorite book. I said that she was very careless and told her to stop touching my things. She felt very sad because I was very impolite to her. But at last, I found that my book was under my bed, which meant my mum didn’t throw my book. I realized I have hurt my mum, so I apologized to her in person. Finally, my mum forgave me and told me not to be impolite again. I learnt I should not quarrel at anyone immediately. I should not be impolite to my parents too.

##Question 3

*Some characters are being stereotyped in the film. For example, Judy Hopps is being stereotyped as a carrot farmer, because a rabbit is usually a carrot farmer in the film, but not a cop. So the others laugh at Judy because she is a police. Also in the film, Nick Wilde is being stereotyped as a cunning animal. When Bonnie and Stu Hopps know their daughter has become the police in Zootopia, they give her a fox repellent to avoid cunning foxes. This shows people in Zootopia stereotype many other animals.
	
*I think the director attempts to get rid of racial and gender stereotypes in the film. The film tells people not to stereotype and discriminate others by the stereotyping of animals. This tells the audience not to stereotype other races. For instance, Judy Hopps is stereotyped by chief Bogo that she is not able to handle the 14 missing mammals’ case. But at last, Judy Hopps manages to find all the missing mammals. This shows that stereotyping is bad. Audience can learn from it and stop stereotyping others. For the gender stereotyping, the director shows that not every female are kind. The villain of the film is Bellwether, who is female, so we should not stereotype other by his or her gender.
	
*I have ever conformed to stereotyping. Once I was being stereotyped by a relative as a sporty guy, but actually, I am not. Many people think all boys love sports and do exercise very often. This made me feel very embarrassed because I do not like sport. She felt sorry that she stereotyped me.
	
*There are many problems of stereotyping to individuals and society as a whole. For individuals, people may get hurt by others easily. One’s self-esteem may also be destroyed because they felt they are being laughed at. For the society, stereotyping may lead to social instability because everyone dislikes each other. Everyone are not willing to trust each other, which is a very serious problem.

##Question 4

*I think utopia cannot exist on Earth because different people may have different points of view. There are many different ethnic groups in the world, such as Chinese, Americans, Africans, etc. Some of them may be selfish and they just care about their group only. They don’t want others to as happy and wealthy as they can, so not everyone in the world can work well with each other and is happy.

*I think Zootopia is not a utopia. Different animals are being stereotyped and discriminated in the film. For example, Judy Hopps is being stereotyped as a carrot farmer, because a rabbit is usually a carrot farmer in the film, but not a cop. So the others laugh at Judy because she is a police. Also in the film, Nick Wilde is being stereotyped as a cunning animal. When Bonnie and Stu Hopps know their daughter has become the police in Zootopia, they give her a fox repellent to avoid cunning foxes. These shows animals in Zootopia do not live happily with each other.

*For the similarities between Hong Kong and Zootopia, there are many ethnic groups in Hong Kong, such as Filipino, Pakistanis, Indians, etc. Some people in Hong Kong often stereotype these people because of their skin colors and living places. Some Hong Kong people even stereotype them as thieves because some of these people has been caught for robbing. Zootopia is also a city full of stereotyping.

*For the differences between Hong Kong and Zootopia, people in Hong Kong still do not want to change the current situation. Having so many discrimination and stereotyping, people do not aware of its seriousness and keep stereotyping and discriminating others. For example, new comers from mainland are often discriminated as dirty and uneducated people, but that is not always true. In Zootopia, there are protests by animals and want to change the situation of Zootopia. They voice out for peace and love because preys are afraid of predators and want to get rid of them.

*I sometimes love Hong Kong because some people are able to voice out at a certain moment.
